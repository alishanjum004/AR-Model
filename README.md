Project Description :
This project uses Augmented Reality to simplify medical diagnosis. By scanning a patient report, a 3D human body model appears with the patient's medical details displayed on top of it. This helps doctors quickly access key information without reading the entire report, making the process faster and more efficient.
This project was created with the help of a 3-day bootcamp of Augumented Reality and as a part of the AR Hackthon, this was the project made by me on improved medical diagnosis using AR.
Built using Unity and C#.
